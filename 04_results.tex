Our study demonstrates the efficacy of our methodology in enhancing the visual presentation of objects within 3D reconstructions. As depicted in Figure 1, the unprocessed Panoptic reconstruction exhibits visual artificats and irregularities, while our approach yields smoothed surfaces, facilitating improved recognition through visual observation. Additionally, we observe the sensitivity of our alignment procedure to the instance masks generated by Panoptic. Although the predicted objects maintain smoothness (likely due to the conditioning in SDFusion), our alignment algorithm occasionally results in object intersection, as illustrated in Figure 2.
