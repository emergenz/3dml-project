\section{Results}

We observe that our method successfully increases the visual appeal of the objects in the 3D reconstruction. As visible in figure 1, the raw panoptic reconstruction contains visual artifacts, whereas our method creates smooth surfaces and allows for more simple recognition-by-observation of the objects. We further observe that our alignment method is sensitive to the instance masks predicted by Panoptic. While the predicted objects remain smooth, our alignment algorithm leads to intersection of the objects as can be seen in figure 2.
