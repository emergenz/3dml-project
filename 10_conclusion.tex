In summary, our methods has demonstrated the efficacy of employing a reconstruction and a diffusion model to enhance aesthetic quality of visual scenes. This approach can be a powerful tool to elevate the immersive experience such as in virtual reality and augmented reality. Our findings underscore the potential of our method and can serve as a starting point for future research to further increase the quality and alignment of the reconstructed objects.
