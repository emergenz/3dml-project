Panoptic 3D scene reconstruction describes the joint task of geometric reconstruction, 3D semantic segmentation, and 3D instance
segmentation. A multitude of tasks in robotics, augmented reality and human-computer interaction rely on this comprehensive understanding of 3D scenes. Extending prior work which performs panoptic 3D scene reconstruction from a single RGB image, our proposal aims to enhance the visual clarity and discernibility of the generated geometry using an additional object-level generative approach. Leveraging an existing 3D asset generation framework, we integrate object-level reconstruction into the 3D scene, yielding superior aesthetic quality.
