   Panoptic 3D Scene Reconstruction describes the joint task of geometric reconstruction, 3D semantic segmentation, and 3D instance
segmentation. A multitude of tasks in Robotics, Augmented Reality and Human-Computer Interaction rely on this comprehensive understanding of 3d scenes. Building upon the method introduced by Dahnert et al. \citep{dahnert2021panoptic}, which performs panoptic 3D scene reconstruction from a single RGB image, our proposal aims to enhance the visual clarity and discernibility of the generated geometry through a Retrieval-inspired approach.  Leveraging a 3D asset generation framework \citep{cheng2023sdfusion}, we conduct object-level reconstruction conditioned on semantic labels and image input, further advancing the capabilities of panoptic 3D scene reconstruction.
